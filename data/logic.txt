M|1|Which is a proposition?|x + 2 = 5|2 + 2 = 5|Hello world!|Read this carefully.|What time is it?|B|A proposition must be a declarative sentence that is true or false. '2+2=5' is false, so it is a proposition.|Look for a sentence that declares a fact.|Commands and questions are not propositions.|Logic_Basics
M|2|What is the negation of "Today is Monday"?|Today is not Monday|Today is Tuesday|Yesterday was Sunday|Tomorrow is Tuesday|It is not true that tomorrow is Monday|A|The negation of p is "It is not the case that p".|Simply insert 'not' into the sentence.|Do not assume it must be Tuesday; it could be Wednesday.|Logic_Basics
M|3|p -> q is FALSE only when:|p is True, q is True|p is True, q is False|p is False, q is True|p is False, q is False|Always False|B|Implication is false only when the hypothesis is True and the conclusion is False (Broken Promise).|Think of a promise: If T then F is a broken promise.|Check the truth table for Implication.|Logic_TruthTable
M|4|Which is the Contrapositive of p -> q?|q -> p|~p -> ~q|~q -> ~p|p and ~q|~p or q|C|The contrapositive of p -> q is ~q -> ~p and they are logically equivalent.|Swap the order and negate both.|Reverse and Negate.|Logic_Equivalence
M|5|De Morgan's Law: ~(p AND q) is equivalent to:|~p AND ~q|~p OR ~q|p OR q|p AND ~q|~p AND q|B|The negation of AND is OR, with both variables negated.|Flip the operator and negate the parts.|~(AB) = ~A + ~B|Logic_Equivalence
M|6|Which statement is a Tautology?|p AND ~p|p OR ~p|p -> ~p|p <-> ~p|p AND q|B|p OR ~p is always True regardless of p's value (Law of Excluded Middle).|Try setting p=True and p=False.|A tautology is always true.|Logic_Tautology
M|7|If "All men are mortal" (For all x, M(x)), what is the negation?|No men are mortal|Some men are mortal|Some men are not mortal|All men are not mortal|Someone is immortal|C|The negation of "For all" is "There exists... NOT". So, "There exists a man who is not mortal".|Negation of Universal is Existential Not.|~(For all x) = Exists x such that not...|Logic_Quantifiers
M|8|Rule of Inference: If p->q is True and p is True, then q is True. This is called:|Modus Tollens|Hypothetical Syllogism|Modus Ponens|Simplification|Addition|C|Modus Ponens: p implies q; p is true; therefore q is true.|Think: Mode of Placing/Affirming.|If P then Q, and P happens, then Q must happen.|Logic_Inference
M|9|Which is logically equivalent to p <-> q?|(p->q) AND (q->p)|(p->q) OR (q->p)|~p -> q|p AND q|~p AND ~q|A|Biconditional p <-> q means p implies q AND q implies p.|It means both directions must hold.|If and only if.|Logic_Equivalence
M|10|What is the Converse of p -> q?|~p -> ~q|~q -> ~p|q -> p|~q -> p|p AND q|C|The converse simply swaps the order: q -> p.|Just swap positions.|Do not negate anything.|Logic_Equivalence
M|11|Translate: "Someone in this class has visited Mars" (C(x): in class, V(x): visited Mars)|For all x, C(x) -> V(x)|Exists x, C(x) AND V(x)|Exists x, C(x) -> V(x)|For all x, C(x) AND V(x)|Exists x, V(x)|B|"Someone" implies Existential quantifier. They must be BOTH in class AND visited Mars.|Use 'Exists' for 'Someone'.|Don't use implication with 'Exists'.|Logic_Translation
M|12|Evaluate Truth Value: If 1+1=3, then dogs can fly.|True|False|Cannot determine|Paradox|Undefined|A|The hypothesis (1+1=3) is False. In p->q, if p is False, the statement is automatically True.|Check the truth table for F -> ?|False implies anything is True.|Logic_TruthTable
M|13|Rule of Inference: If p->q and ~q, therefore ~p.|Modus Ponens|Modus Tollens|Disjunctive Syllogism|Resolution|Conjunction|B|Modus Tollens: Denying the consequent.|If result is false, condition must be false.|Contrapositive logic.|Logic_Inference
M|14|~(Exists x, P(x)) is equivalent to:|Exists x, ~P(x)|For all x, P(x)|For all x, ~P(x)|Exists x, P(x)|~For all x, P(x)|C|To negate "Exists", change to "For all" and negate the predicate.|None exist means All are NOT.|De Morgan for Quantifiers.|Logic_Quantifiers
M|15|In logic, "OR" usually means:|Exclusive OR (one or other, not both)|Inclusive OR (one or other, or both)|NAND|NOR|XNOR|B|Standard mathematical 'OR' is Inclusive.|It covers the case where both are true.|True if at least one is True.|Logic_Basics
M|16|Which of the following is a Contradiction?|(p OR ~p)|(p AND ~p)|(p -> q)|(p <-> p)|~p|B|A contradiction is always False. p AND ~p can never be true.|Try Truth Table.|You can't be both True and False at once.|Logic_Tautology
M|17|(p OR q) AND ~p implies:|p|q|~q|p AND q|~p|B|Disjunctive Syllogism: If (p or q) is true, but p is false, then q MUST be true.|Elimination method.|If it's A or B, and it's not A, it's B.|Logic_Inference
M|18|How many rows are in a truth table with n variables?|n|2n|n^2|2^n|n!|D|Each variable has 2 possibilities (T/F), so 2 * 2 * ... n times.|Binary combinations.|Same as number of subsets.|Logic_Basics
M|19|Let P(x, y) be "x loves y". "Everyone loves someone" is:|For all x, Exists y, P(x,y)|Exists x, For all y, P(x,y)|Exists y, For all x, P(x,y)|For all y, Exists x, P(x,y)|For all x, For all y, P(x,y)|A|"Everyone" comes first (For all x), then "someone" (Exists y).|Order matters.|For every person, there is a person they love.|Logic_Translation
M|20|p -> q is logically equivalent to:|~p AND q|~p OR q|p AND ~q|~q -> p|~(p -> q)|B|This is a key equivalence: Implication can be written as Not p OR q.|Check Truth Table of ~p OR q.|If p is true, q must be true; if p is false, it's true anyway.|Logic_Equivalence
