M|1|How many nonnegative integer solutions are there to x1 + x2 + x3 = 4?|4|5|10|15|20|D|Using stars and bars, the number of solutions is C(4+3−1,3−1)=C(6,2)=15.
M|2|How many functions are there from a 4-element set to a 3-element set?|7|12|24|64|81|E|Each of 4 domain elements has 3 choices, so there are 3^4 = 81 functions.
M|3|How many permutations of the word 'LEVEL' are there?|5|10|20|30|60|D|LEVEL has 5 letters with L twice and E twice, so 5!/(2!2!) = 120/4 = 30.
M|4|By the pigeonhole principle, how many people are needed to guarantee that at least two share the same birthday (ignoring leap years)?|364|365|366|367|730|C|With 366 people and only 365 days, at least two must share a birthday.
M|5|A committee of 3 people is chosen from 5 men and 4 women. How many committees contain at least 1 woman?|5C3|9C3 − 5C3|9C3 − 4C3|4C1·5C2|4C2·5C1|B|Total committees is C(9,3); all-male committees is C(5,3), so answer is C(9,3) − C(5,3).
