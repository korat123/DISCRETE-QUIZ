M|1|Which of the following functions has growth rate O(n^2)?|n log n|n^2|n^3|2^n|n^2 log n|B|Among the options, n^2 has growth rate O(n^2).
M|2|Which statement about Big-O notation is correct?|f(n) is a member of O(g(n)) means f grows faster than g|f(n) is a member of O(g(n)) means f grows slower than g|f(n) is a member of O(g(n)) means there exist c,n0 such that f(n) <= c·g(n) for all n >= n0|f(n) is a member of O(g(n)) means f(n) = g(n) for all n|Big-O is defined only for polynomials|C|By definition, f(n) is a member of O(g(n)) if f(n) <= c·g(n) for sufficiently large n.
M|3|Let f(n) = 3n^2 + 5n + 1. Which of the following is true?|f(n) is a member of O(n)|f(n) is a member of O(n log n)|f(n) is a member of O(n^2)|f(n) is a member of O(n^3)|f(n) is not a member of O(n^2)|C|The highest-order term is n^2, so f(n) is a member of O(n^2).
M|4|What is the time complexity of a nested loop: for i = 1..n, for j = 1..n, do constant work?|O(1)|O(log n)|O(n)|O(n log n)|O(n^2)|E|Two nested loops from 1 to n give n·n operations, so O(n^2).
M|5|Which statement is true if f(n) is a member of O(g(n))?|There exist c,n0 such that f(n) >= c*g(n) for all n >= n0|There exist c,n0 such that f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0|f(n) = g(n) for all n|g(n) is a member of O(f(n)) must also hold|f(n) grows strictly slower than g(n) for all n|B|By definition of Big-O, f(n) <= c*g(n) for sufficiently large n.
