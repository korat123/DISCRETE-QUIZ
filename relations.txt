M|1|Which of the following properties defines an equivalence relation on a set?|Reflexive and symmetric only|Symmetric and transitive only|Reflexive and transitive only|Reflexive, symmetric, and transitive|Symmetric only|D|An equivalence relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
M|2|On the set of integers, the relation a R b if a − b is even is:|Only reflexive|Reflexive and symmetric but not transitive|Reflexive and transitive but not symmetric|An equivalence relation|Neither reflexive nor symmetric nor transitive|D|a − b even defines an equivalence relation (same parity).
M|3|Which of the following is an example of a partial order on a set?|The relation 'is friend of' on people|The relation 'less than' (<) on real numbers|The relation 'less than or equal to' (<=) on real numbers|The relation 'is sibling of' on people|The relation 'is married to' on people|C|<=(less than or equal to) is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, so it is a partial order.
M|4|A relation R on a set A is antisymmetric if:|aRb implies bRa|aRb and bRa implies a = b|aRb implies a = b|aRb implies not bRa|R is symmetric and transitive|B|Antisymmetric means if aRb and bRa, then a must equal b.
M|5|Which combination of properties guarantees that a relation R is a partial order?|Reflexive and symmetric|Symmetric and transitive|Reflexive, symmetric, and transitive|Reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive|Antisymmetric and transitive only|D|A partial order must be reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
